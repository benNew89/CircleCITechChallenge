**CircleCI Tech Challenge**

This is part 1 of a technical challenge for the support engineer role at CircleCI

**Tech used**

I've used Jest, HTML and vanilla JavaScript to create this basic application which displays some text below a button, when the button is clicked

**Development**

If you'd like to run this locally, clone the repo and then:
  

 1. `yarn install` (or `npm install`) to install dependencies
 2. `yarn start` (or `npm start`) to preview the app locally
 3. `yarn test` (or `npm test`) to run the tests
